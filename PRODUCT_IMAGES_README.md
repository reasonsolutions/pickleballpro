# Product Images Display Fix

## Issue
The first image in a product's image list should show as the main image for the product card in the Shop page.

## Solution
The code was already correctly implemented to display the first image from the `mediaUrls` array. The issue was that the "Test" product in the screenshot didn't have any images uploaded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Image Display Logic (`src/pages/Shop.tsx`)
Improved the robustness of the image display logic to handle edge cases:

```typescript
{product.mediaUrls && Array.isArray(product.mediaUrls) && product.mediaUrls.length > 0 && product.mediaUrls[0] ? (
  <Image
    src={product.mediaUrls[0]}  // First image from the array
    alt={product.title}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    fallbackSrc="/api/placeholder/300/300"
  />
) : (
  <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-200">
    <RiShoppingCartLine className="text-4xl text-gray-400" />
  </div>
)}
```

### 2. Test Scripts Created
- `src/scripts/setupTestProducts.ts` - Creates sample products with images
- `src/scripts/testProductImages.ts` - Tests the image display logic

## How It Works

1. **Product Model**: Products have a `mediaUrls: string[]` field that stores an array of image URLs
2. **Display Logic**: The Shop page displays `product.mediaUrls[0]` (first image) if available
3. **Fallback**: Shows a placeholder icon when no images are available
4. **Image Upload**: The AddProduct page allows uploading up to 4 images, stored in the `mediaUrls` array

## Testing

### Option 1: Create Test Products with Images
1. Open browser console in your app
2. Run: `setupTestProducts()`
3. This will create sample products with placeholder images from Unsplash

### Option 2: Add Images to Existing Products
1. Go to Shop page as a facility manager
2. Click "Edit" on any product
3. Upload images using the image upload section
4. Save the product
5. The first uploaded image will appear as the main product image

### Option 3: Test Current Products
1. Open browser console in your app
2. Run: `testProductImages()`
3. This will analyze all products and show which ones have images vs placeholders

## Expected Behavior

- **Products with images**: Display the first image from `mediaUrls[0]`
- **Products without images**: Display a shopping cart placeholder icon
- **Image ordering**: Images can be reordered by drag-and-drop in the AddProduct page
- **Multiple images**: Up to 4 images per product (only first one shows in product card)

## File Structure

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── Shop.tsx              # Main shop display (UPDATED)
│   └── AddProduct.tsx        # Product creation/editing
├── scripts/

│   └── testProductImages.ts  # Tests image display (NEW)
└── firebase/
    └── models.ts             # Product model definition
```

## Notes

- The image display was already working correctly
- The "Test" product in your screenshot simply had no images uploaded
- The enhanced logic provides better error handling for edge cases
- Test scripts help verify functionality and create sample data
